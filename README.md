# My-Profile-
Testing what i learnt by making my own profile 
This is my first time using GitHub and honestly i think im getting the hang of it.
Im Romanian and i spend a lot of my time on computers so the field of cyber security really appealed to me. Im also a gym rat so i spend a lot of time, effort and money to stay phsically fit.
