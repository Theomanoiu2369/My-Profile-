# My-Profile-
Testing what i learnt by making my own profile 
This is my first time using GitHub and honestly i think im getting the hang of it.
Im Romanian and i spend a lot of my time on computers so the field of cyber security really appealed to me. Im also a gym rat so i spend a lot of time, effort and money to stay phsically fit.
This is me edditing the file to put to use what ive learned about merging and pull requests. 
More about me: Im pretty self confident and sometimes it looks like i have a MASSIVE ego which tbf i probably do. But ive worked hard to justify having that ego.
